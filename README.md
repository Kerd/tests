# tests
This repository is for internal use only - to keep different code snippets and tests in one place.
Code in the repository is derived from tutorials, other sources, written myself or borrowed from other projects.
If part of code is taken, original authors most likely will not be mentioned. If whole file is taken as base, it may keep original copyright. But most likely those files are heavily modified for my needs and may differ from original versions. If code is here, probably i used it one way or another in my projects and to improve my knowlege in specific areas. If you believe you must be mentioned somewhere as original author, feel free to contact me.

WARNING!!! Some code in this repository may do something dangerous, harmful and not work as expected. Tests, just tests... Have fun. :)
